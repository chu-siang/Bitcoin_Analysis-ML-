    "Two models were trained to predict Bitcoin price movements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Forest Regressor**: Achieved an R² of 0.32, indicating it explains about 32% of the variance in price movements.\n",
    "2. **Support Vector Regressor**: Showed negative R² performance, suggesting it may need further optimization."
